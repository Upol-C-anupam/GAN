1. used fashion items' images(t-shirt, shoes, bags)
       -> for this I have used https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist
       -> snippets after loading the dataset
    ![Demo](https://github.com/Upol-C-anupam/GAN/assets/108279802/812361b8-3ec4-4730-a75c-d6605f3a7dc4)
    
2. built generator and discriminator. Below is the snippet of the subclassed model
     ![subclass_model](https://github.com/Upol-C-anupam/GAN/assets/108279802/b8a5f93e-ecbd-4f4f-81f4-3a67e8118fcd)

3. I have run the model for 2000 epoch and have got satisfactory result regarding image generation.
